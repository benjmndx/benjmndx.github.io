You are in a very difficult and uncomfortable position because I think leadership is more difficult now than it has ever been. You're dealing with human anxiety, uncertainty, ambition, and egos. Especially young people who think they know what they want and don't, who have certainty and are very outspoken, and do not mind going around their boss's boss to come to you. You know, so you're going to be dealing with a 19-year-old saying, "Why am I not given this?" and you're like, "I don't know, where do you work?"

They have no fear of doing that; they also have no fear of quitting. And so we've seen this pattern where, remember, as a young generation, they're actually less equipped to deal with stress than previous generations. Anxiety is high, and they're very confrontation avoidant. So, for example, we've seen this where they feel like they deserve a raise and they don't know how to ask for one. Instead of asking for a raise, they'll just quit, and then sometimes with an email that says, "You don't value me, you don't pay me enough," you're like, "You just had to ask, we love you."

So, they're not afraid of quitting, but they are afraid of asking for things or, if they do ask, it sometimes comes across very aggressive or accidentally black and white like, "I've been here eight months and I would like a 50% raise." And I'm not exaggerating. The problem is that they're ill-equipped; what they're doing is they're putting you in a yes or no position. So even if you say, "Here's the plan to get you that over the course of the next eight months," they take it as a no because they asked for something black and white.

One of the things I think there's a huge opportunity for a company is to help people to build in training that helps them with their human skills. I hate the term "soft skills"; please let's never use that term again. We talk about hard skills and soft skills; those things are opposites. Hard and soft are opposites; there are hard skills, the skills you need to do your job, and human skills, the skills you need to be a better human being, and we want you to excel at both, and we're going to train you to do both.

Some of the human skills that are underappreciated and undertrained in this day and age are how to have difficult conversations, how to have effective confrontation, how to give and receive feedback. And I think we have to train those things so that if we equip them with the skills, instead of saying, "I've been here for eight months, I want a raise," to say, "I've been here for eight months, I really love it here. My goal is to stay here. I have financial ambitions; can you help me get on a path to get to this number?" Now we can have a conversation because it's now a continuum rather than a black and white question.

But the point is, I don't fault them; they lack the skills. And so I think there's a huge opportunity for an organization like yours to teach these young people coping mechanisms, stress relief, the biggest one being how to ask for help. That is the single biggest thing that is lacking in every generation, which is, "I am struggling, can you help me?" Whether it's personal or professional, that is absolutely lacking. And so we do unhealthy things to help compensate, like social media and other things.

## Key points
1. **Young Employees' Boldness**: Young workers are not afraid to bypass hierarchy and directly approach top management with their demands, showing a lack of fear in questioning their roles or the recognition they believe they deserve.
2. **Fear of Confrontation vs. Quitting**: Despite their boldness in some areas, many young employees avoid direct confrontation, particularly when it comes to negotiating raises or expressing dissatisfaction. Instead of addressing issues, they may choose to quit.
3. **Lack of Coping Mechanisms**: The younger generation is less equipped to handle stress compared to their predecessors, leading to high levels of anxiety and a tendency to avoid confrontation.
4. **Communication and Negotiation Skills**: There's a notable gap in effective communication and negotiation skills among young workers. For instance, they might demand unreasonable raises without understanding how to engage in a constructive dialogue about their career path and compensation.
5. **Training Opportunities**: Companies should invest in training that enhances 'human skills', such as effective communication, confrontation, feedback exchange, and negotiation, moving away from the term 'soft skills'.
6. **Asking for Help**: A significant issue identified is the general reluctance across all generations to seek help when facing challenges, whether personal or professional. This as a critical area for development, suggesting that teaching young employees how to ask for help could address many underlying issues.
